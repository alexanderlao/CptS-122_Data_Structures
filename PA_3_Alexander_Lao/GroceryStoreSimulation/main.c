 * Description: This program simulates two grocery store lines in order        *
 *				to better understand how to select the fastest line.           *
 *																			   *
 * IMPORTANT NOTES: The majority of these functions were adapted from the      *
 *					queue example we did in class. They have been modified to  *
 *					fit the functionality of this assignment.                  *
 *					Lung-Chi Lin and Kelsey Cairns assisted me on this         *
 *					assignment.                                                *
