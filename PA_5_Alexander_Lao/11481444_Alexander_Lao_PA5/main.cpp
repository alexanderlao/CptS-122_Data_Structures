 * Description: This application marks absences, reads from text/csv files,    *
 *				and writes to text files.                                      *

 * Note: Lung-Chi Lin helped me on this assignment. Some functions were        *
 *		 adapted from the in-class examples (destroyList, overloaded           *
 *		 assignment operator).                                                 *
